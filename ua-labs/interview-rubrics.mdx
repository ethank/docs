# UA Labs Interview Rubrics

## Philosophy

Traditional interviews test for traditional skills. We're hiring for a different kind of work:

- **AIAD fluency** over raw coding ability
- **Shipping velocity** over architectural perfection
- **Autonomy** over collaboration preferences
- **Transparency** over polish

Every interview stage has one question: **"Will this person ship fast in our environment?"**

---

## Builder Interview Process

### Stage 1: Portfolio Review (Async, 30 min evaluation)

**What they submit:**
- Links to shipped products (live, not "in development")
- Description of their AIAD workflow
- One paragraph on why Labs appeals to them

**Evaluation Criteria:**

| Criteria | Strong Signal | Weak Signal | Disqualify |
|----------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Shipped Work | Multiple live products | One significant project | Only "worked on" at companies |
| Recency | Shipped in last 6 months | Shipped in last 12 months | Nothing shipped in 2+ years |
| Scope Ownership | Built end-to-end alone | Owned significant portions | "Contributed to" only |
| AIAD Usage | AI tools are primary workflow | Uses AI tools regularly | Skeptical of AI tools |
| Why Labs | Resonates with speed/autonomy | General interest in startups | Wants stability/process |

**Pass threshold:** Strong signal on Shipped Work + AIAD Usage, no disqualifiers

**Time to decision:** 24 hours max

---

### Stage 2: Live Coding Session (60 min, synchronous)

**Format:** Build something real together using AI tools

**Setup:**
- Candidate shares screen
- They use their normal dev environment (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
- We give them a problem, they solve it live
- We observe workflow, not just output

**Sample Prompts:**

1. "Build a simple API that takes a song description and returns AI-generated metadata (genre, mood, instruments). Deploy it somewhere we can hit."

2. "Create a React component that visualizes an audio waveform from a file upload. Make it look good enough to ship."

3. "Build a Discord bot that responds to music-related questions using an LLM. Get it running in a test server."

**What We're Watching:**

| Behavior | Strong Signal | Weak Signal | Red Flag |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| AI Usage | Prompts AI first, iterates | Uses AI for some parts | Doesn't use AI |
| Speed | Working in 30 min, polished by 60 | Working at 45 min | Still debugging at 60 min |
| Problem Decomposition | Ships incrementally | Executes sequentially | Architects everything upfront |
| Shipping Instinct | Deploys early, iterates | Deploys when "ready" | Wants to "finish first" |
| Stack Decisions | Uses what's fastest | Uses familiar tools | Debates tooling extensively |

**Scoring:**

- **5 - Exceptional:** Shipped polished solution in under 45 min using AI fluidly
- **4 - Strong:** Working solution by 60 min, good AI usage
- **3 - Acceptable:** Mostly working, some struggles, right instincts
- **2 - Weak:** Incomplete or significant struggles
- **1 - No hire:** Didn't ship, poor AI usage, or major red flags

**Pass threshold:** 4+ required, 3 only with strong Stage 1

---

### Stage 3: Culture Conversation (30 min, synchronous)

**Interviewer:** CTO or senior Labs member

**Purpose:** Validate alignment on autonomy, transparency, speed

**Question 1: "Tell me about a time you shipped something you weren't proud of."**
- Strong: Clear example, shipped anyway, learned and iterated
- Weak: Example exists but hedged with caveats
- Red flag: "I don't ship things I'm not proud of"

**Question 2: "How do you decide when something is ready to ship?"**
- Strong: "When core value works, I ship and iterate"
- Weak: "When I've tested the main flows"
- Red flag: "When it's complete and polished"

**Question 3: "Describe your ideal working relationship with a manager."**
- Strong: "Set direction, get out of my way"
- Weak: "Regular check-ins for alignment"
- Red flag: "Clear requirements and feedback"

**Question 4: "How do you feel about sharing work-in-progress publicly?"**
- Strong: Excited, has done it, sees the value
- Weak: Open to it, hasn't done much
- Red flag: Uncomfortable, prefers polished only

**Question 5: "What's your reaction when a project gets killed?"**
- Strong: "Part of the game, move on fast"
- Weak: "Disappointing but understandable"
- Red flag: "Frustrated, feels like waste"

**Question 6: "How do you use AI tools in your daily work?"**
- Strong: Specific examples, AI is primary workflow
- Weak: Uses regularly for specific tasks
- Red flag: "I use it sometimes" / vague

**Pass threshold:** 4+ on culture fit required

## Amplifier Interview Process

### Stage 1: Presence Review (Async, 30 min evaluation)

| Criteria | Strong Signal | Weak Signal | Disqualify |
|----------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| Community Experience | Built community from zero | Managed existing community | No community experience |
| Content Quality | Engaging, authentic, consistent | Good content, inconsistent | Polished but inauthentic |
| Platform Fluency | Native to Discord, Twitter, TikTok | Comfortable on 1-2 platforms | Only uses LinkedIn |
| Engagement Style | Warm, creates conversations | Professional, informative | Broadcast only |
| Authenticity | Real personality visible | Somewhat polished but genuine | Corporate voice |

---

### Stage 2: Community Scenario (45 min, synchronous)

**Scenario 1: Day 1 Launch**

"We just launched our Discord server for Guitar Playground. We have 50 members who signed up from our waitlist. It's day 1. What do you do in the first week?"

- Strong: Specific tactics (welcome flow, first post, engagement hooks)
- Weak: General ideas about community building
- Red flag: "Wait for people to post"

**Scenario 2: Negative Feedback**

"A beta user posts: 'This app is honestly disappointing. The latency makes it unusable.' Three others react with thumbs up. How do you handle this?"

- Strong: Acknowledge publicly, thank for feedback, loop in Builder
- Weak: Respond professionally, apologize
- Red flag: Delete or hide the post

**Scenario 3: Content Cadence**

"You need to post daily updates. Today, the Builders are heads-down fixing a gnarly bug. What do you post?"

- Strong: Shows the struggle authentically
- Weak: Posts something generic
- Red flag: Skips the day

**Scenario 4: Experiment Killed**

"We just killed an experiment after 8 weeks. How do you communicate this to the 500 people in our community?"

- Strong: Transparent post about what we learned
- Weak: Professional announcement
- Red flag: Try to spin it positively

---

## Platform Lead Interview Process

### Stage 2: Architecture Session (60 min)

**Prompt:** "Walk me through how you'd build the Zoo platform to support multiple experiment pods shipping daily. They need: LLM integrations, auth, basic billing, deployment pipelines. You have 4 weeks to first experiment launch."

| Topic | Strong Signal | Weak Signal | Red Flag |
|-------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Scope | Ruthlessly minimal for week 1 | Reasonable prioritization | Complete system design |
| Build vs Buy | Heavy buy/rent bias | Some buy, some build | Wants to build core infra |
| LLM Integration | Direct API calls first | Portkey from start | Custom LLM gateway |
| Auth | Clerk or similar | Build simple auth | JWT + custom |
| Deployment | Railway/Vercel | Managed Kubernetes | Custom pipeline |
| Pod Support | Self-service, minimal process | Light-touch support | Approval processes |

## Interview Principles

1. **Speed in interviewing signals speed in culture.** Complete process in less than 1 week.

2. **Watch behavior, not claims.** Live coding shows actual workflow. Scenarios show actual instincts.

3. **Disqualifiers matter more than qualifiers.** One red flag outweighs multiple strong signals.

4. **Culture fit isn't "nice to have."** Someone who ships fast but can't work transparently will fail.

5. **Trust your gut on energy.** Labs needs people who are excited by the model, not just accepting of it.

6. **Over-hire on AIAD fluency.** This is the differentiating skill. Technical gaps can be closed; workflow habits are hard to change.

## Post-Interview

- **Decision within 24 hours** of final stage
- **Offer extended within 48 hours** of decision
- **Debrief documented** in hiring channel for pattern recognition
- **Rejection feedback** offered to all candidates who completed Stage 2+

Hiring is the most important thing we do. Get it right, everything else follows. Get it wrong, nothing else matters.
