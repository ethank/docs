# UA Labs Interview Rubrics

## Philosophy

Traditional interviews test for traditional skills. We're hiring for a different kind of work:

- **AIAD fluency** over raw coding ability
- **Shipping velocity** over architectural perfection
- **Autonomy** over collaboration preferences
- **Transparency** over polish

Every interview stage has one question: **"Will this person ship fast in our environment?"**

---

## Builder Interview Process

### Stage 1: Portfolio Review (Async, 30 min evaluation)

**What they submit:**
- Links to shipped products (live, not "in development")
- Description of their AIAD workflow
- One paragraph on why Labs appeals to them

**Evaluation Criteria:**

| Criteria | Strong Signal | Weak Signal | Disqualify |
|----------|--------------|-------------|------------|
| **Shipped Work** | Multiple live products, can demo them | One significant project, clearly their work | Only "worked on" at companies, nothing independent |
| **Recency** | Shipped something in last 6 months | Shipped in last 12 months | Nothing shipped in 2+ years |
| **Scope Ownership** | Built end-to-end alone or as clear lead | Owned significant portions | "Contributed to" / unclear ownership |
| **AIAD Usage** | AI tools are primary workflow, specific examples | Uses AI tools regularly | "I've tried Copilot" / skeptical of AI tools |
| **Why Labs** | Specific resonance with speed/autonomy/transparency | General interest in startups | Wants stability / process / clear requirements |

**Pass threshold:** Strong signal on Shipped Work + AIAD Usage, no disqualifiers

**Time to decision:** 24 hours max

---

### Stage 2: Live Coding Session (60 min, synchronous)

**Format:** Build something real together using AI tools

**Setup:**
- Candidate shares screen
- They use their normal dev environment (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
- We give them a problem, they solve it live
- We observe workflow, not just output

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sample Prompts">
    1. "Build a simple API that takes a song description and returns AI-generated metadata (genre, mood, instruments). Deploy it somewhere we can hit."

    2. "Create a React component that visualizes an audio waveform from a file upload. Make it look good enough to ship."

    3. "Build a Discord bot that responds to music-related questions using an LLM. Get it running in a test server."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**What We're Watching:**

| Behavior | Strong Signal | Weak Signal | Red Flag |
|----------|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **AI Usage** | Prompts AI first, iterates on output, uses AI for debugging | Uses AI for some parts, codes others manually | Doesn't use AI, or uses it awkwardly |
| **Speed** | Something working in 30 min, polished by 60 | Working at 45 min, rough but functional | Still debugging basic setup at 60 min |
| **Problem Decomposition** | Breaks into small pieces, ships incrementally | Has a plan, executes sequentially | Tries to architect everything upfront |
| **Debugging Approach** | Uses AI to diagnose, tries quick fixes, moves on | Systematic debugging, finds issues | Gets stuck, spirals on one problem |
| **Shipping Instinct** | Deploys early with rough version, iterates | Deploys at end when "ready" | Doesn't deploy, wants to "finish first" |
| **Stack Decisions** | Uses what's fastest (Vercel, Railway, whatever) | Uses familiar tools even if slower | Debates tooling choices extensively |

**Scoring:**

```
5 - Exceptional: Shipped polished, working solution in <45 min using AI fluidly
4 - Strong: Working solution by 60 min, good AI usage, would ship this
3 - Acceptable: Mostly working, some struggles, but showed right instincts
2 - Weak: Incomplete or significant struggles, unclear if they'd be fast
1 - No hire: Didn't ship, poor AI usage, or major red flags
```

**Pass threshold:** 4+ required, 3 only with strong Stage 1

## Interview Principles

1. **Speed in interviewing signals speed in culture.** Complete process in <1 week.

2. **Watch behavior, not claims.** Live coding shows actual workflow. Scenarios show actual instincts.

3. **Disqualifiers matter more than qualifiers.** One red flag outweighs multiple strong signals.

4. **Culture fit isn't "nice to have."** Someone who ships fast but can't work transparently will fail.

5. **Trust your gut on energy.** Labs needs people who are excited by the model, not just accepting of it.

6. **Over-hire on AIAD fluency.** This is the differentiating skill. Technical gaps can be closed; workflow habits are hard to change.

---

## Post-Interview

- **Decision within 24 hours** of final stage
- **Offer extended within 48 hours** of decision
- **Debrief documented** in hiring channel for pattern recognition
- **Rejection feedback** offered to all candidates who completed Stage 2+

<Warning>
Hiring is the most important thing we do. Get it right, everything else follows. Get it wrong, nothing else matters.
</Warning>
