# UA Labs Job Descriptions

## Builder - AI-Native Full-Stack Engineer

**Location:** Remote (US/Canada/Latin America preferred)

**Reports to:** CTO (initially)

**Compensation:** $160-200K + equity

### About UA Labs

UA Labs is Universal Audio's innovation engine. We ship consumer-facing music apps in 8 weeks or kill them. No roadmaps. No committees. No permission.

We're building the future of music creation for the millions of new musicians that AI is creating right now. Small teams. Big AI leverage. Zero process.

### The Role

You'll be one of two Builders on an experiment pod, shipping daily with AI assistance. You own your vertical from idea to production. You make decisions without asking permission. You build in public - daily updates, weekly demos, failures included.

This isn't a job where you wait for specs. There are no specs. There are problems to solve and users to delight.

### What You'll Do

- Ship features daily using Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI tools
- Own entire product vertical from frontend to backend to deployment
- Make technical decisions autonomously (no committee approval)
- Build in public - daily standup videos, weekly demos, transparent progress
- Iterate based on real user feedback, not theoretical requirements
- Work async-first with a 3-person pod (2 Builders + 1 Amplifier)

### Must Have

- **AIAD fluency** - You already ship code with Claude Code, Cursor, or similar. This is your primary workflow, not an experiment.
- **Shipped something publicly** in the last 12 months. Side project, startup, open source - we want to see what you've launched, not what you've worked on.
- **Full-stack capability** - Can move between React/Swift, Node/Python, databases, and deployment without waiting for specialists.
- **Bias for action** - You'd rather ship an 80% solution today than a perfect one next month.
- **Comfort with ambiguity** - "Figure it out" is an exciting challenge, not a frustrating gap.
- **Public accountability** - Willing to show your work daily, including failures.

### Nice to Have

- Audio/music domain knowledge
- Mobile development experience (iOS/SwiftUI preferred)
- Early-stage startup experience
- Content creation experience (you'll be visible)

### Red Flags (Please Don't Apply If)

- You want detailed requirements before starting
- You're uncomfortable with AI coding assistants as primary tools
- You prefer large team collaboration with defined roles
- You ask about code review process in interviews
- You're concerned about "proper" architecture before shipping

### How We Work

- **Remote-first** - Work from anywhere with Pacific-friendly overlap (10am-2pm PT)
- **Async by default** - Daily video standups (recorded, not live), written decisions
- **Discord is the office** - All work happens in public channels
- **8-week experiments** - Ship or kill, no endless iteration
- **AI-native** - Claude Code, Cursor, v0, whatever ships fastest

### Interview Process

1. **Portfolio review** (async) - Show us what you've shipped
2. **Live coding session** (60 min) - Build something with us using AI tools
3. **Culture conversation** (30 min) - Make sure we're aligned on speed, transparency, autonomy
4. **Offer** - We move fast here too

## Amplifier - Community and Content Lead

**Location:** Remote (US/Canada/Latin America preferred)

**Reports to:** CTO (initially)

**Compensation:** $90-120K + equity

### The Role

You'll be the Amplifier on a 3-person experiment pod, working alongside two Builders. While they ship code, you ship community. You're the bridge between what we're building and the people we're building for.

This role is part community manager, part content creator, part QA tester, part user advocate.

### What You'll Do

| Focus | Time | Activities |
|-------|------|------------|
| Community | 50% | Build Discord community, engage users, run beta programs |
| Content | 30% | Daily updates, short videos, social presence |
| Testing | 20% | First-line QA, synthesize user feedback |

### Must Have

- **Community native** - You've built or managed online communities. Discord experience strongly preferred.
- **Content creator mindset** - Comfortable on camera, can write engaging copy, understands social platforms.
- **User empathy** - You genuinely care about user experience and can articulate what makes products feel good.
- **Public accountability** - Willing to be the face/voice of a product in development.
- **Organized chaos** - Can juggle community, content, and testing without detailed processes.

### Nice to Have

- Audio/music domain knowledge or genuine enthusiasm
- Experience with build-in-public or indie hacker communities
- Previous startup or early-stage experience
- Technical literacy (can understand what Builders are shipping)

### Interview Process

1. **Portfolio/presence review** (async) - Show us communities you've built, content you've created
2. **Community scenario** (45 min) - Walk us through how you'd handle real situations
3. **Culture conversation** (30 min) - Alignment on speed, transparency, scrappiness
4. **Offer**

## Platform Lead - Labs Infrastructure

**Location:** Remote (US/Canada/Latin America preferred)

**Reports to:** CTO

**Compensation:** $200-250K + equity

### The Role

You'll lead the platform team that enables experiment pods to ship at speed. You own the Zoo platform - the infrastructure, AI integrations, auth, billing, and deployment pipelines that let Builders focus on product.

You're an enabler, not a gatekeeper. Your success is measured by how fast pods can ship, not how many approvals you give.

### What You'll Do

- Own and evolve the Zoo platform
- Build and maintain shared AI integrations (LLM gateway, tool framework)
- Set up auth, billing, and infrastructure that "just works"
- Create deployment pipelines that let pods ship without ops tickets
- Lead a small team (1-2 Platform Builders + 1 DevOps/SRE)

### What You're NOT Doing

- Reviewing experiment pod code
- Approving experiment decisions
- Blocking launches
- Imposing process
- Building bureaucracy

### Technical Requirements

- Strong with Node.js/TypeScript
- Experience with: Railway/Vercel, Neon/Postgres, OpenAI/Anthropic APIs
- Comfortable with: Temporal, observability tools, CI/CD
- Can make pragmatic build vs. buy decisions

### Interview Process

1. **Technical review** (async) - Share platforms you've built
2. **Architecture session** (60 min) - Design discussion on Zoo platform
3. **Leadership conversation** (45 min) - How you'd enable fast-moving pods
4. **Offer**

## DevOps/SRE - Labs Infrastructure

**Location:** Remote

**Reports to:** Platform Lead

Own deployment, monitoring, and cost management for UA Labs. Multiple experiment pods shipping daily means you need automation that scales.

## How to Apply

**Include:**

1. **What you've shipped** - Links to live products, open source, side projects. Not descriptions of what you worked on at BigCo.

2. **How you use AI** - Describe your AIAD workflow. What tools? How has it changed how you work?

3. **Why Labs** - One paragraph on why this model appeals to you.

No cover letters. No resumes. Show us what you've built.
