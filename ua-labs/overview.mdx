## Core Philosophy

**"Small teams, big AI, zero process"**

| Dimension | Legacy Division | UA Labs |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| Team Size | 10-30 per team | 2-3 per pod |
| Shipping Cadence | Quarterly releases | Weekly/daily |
| Planning | Roadmaps, PRDs, reviews | 8-week experiments |
| Code Reviews | Multi-stage approval | AI-assisted, trust-based |
| Testing | Full QA cycles | Automated + user feedback |
| AI Usage | Augmentation | Core methodology (AIAD) |

## The 3-Person Experiment Pod

Each experiment gets a single pod:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Builder" icon="code">
    Full-stack + AI native. Ships features daily. Owns vertical end-to-end.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Builder" icon="code">
    Full-stack + AI native. Ships features daily. Owns vertical end-to-end.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Amplifier" icon="bullhorn">
    Community + Content + Testing. Ships community while Builders ship code.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**AI Agents power the pod:** Claude Code, Cursor, v0/Vercel

## Total Headcount

| Role | Count | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Labs Lead | 1 | CTO initially |
| Experiment Pod (Vocal) | 3 | 2 Builders + 1 Amplifier |
| Experiment Pod (Guitar) | 3 | 2 Builders + 1 Amplifier |
| Platform Team | 3-4 | Lead + Builders + DevOps |
| **Total Labs** | **10-11** | |

## Key Design Decisions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hybrid Spinout Model" icon="rocket">
    Successful experiments graduate to their own product teams. Labs stays lean as an incubator. Legacy never absorbs Labs products.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mostly External Hiring" icon="user-plus">
    AIAD fluency is rare in traditional orgs. Hire fresh talent with AI-native workflows. Must demonstrate AIAD workflow in interview.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Remote-First" icon="globe">
    Access global AIAD talent pool. Discord becomes the office. Async by default. Forces documentation discipline.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="CTO Direct Leadership" icon="shield">
    CTO leads Labs for first 6-12 months. Protects from legacy process creep. Then promote Labs Lead from within.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Annual Budget: ~$1.8M

| Category | Cost |
|----------|------|
| 4 Builders @ $180K | $720K |
| 2 Amplifiers @ $100K | $200K |
| 3 Platform @ $170K avg | $510K |
| 1 DevOps @ $160K | $160K |
| Infrastructure & Ops | $226K |

**Compared to traditional:** A 20-person local team costs $4-5M and ships 2-3 features/year. Labs delivers same output for ~40% of cost.

## The Black Box Principle

Labs operates with:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="No Legacy Processes">
    - No Jira (use simple task lists)
    - No multi-week sprints (ship daily)
    - No design reviews (ship and iterate)
    - No code review committees (AI + peer trust)
    - No roadmaps beyond 8 weeks
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="No Legacy Dependencies">
    - Own infrastructure (not shared IT)
    - Own tools (not enterprise-mandated)
    - Own deployment (not release trains)
    - Own decisions (not committee approval)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Clean Interfaces Only">
    - Consume Legacy APIs when needed
    - Provide APIs for Legacy consumption
    - Never share codebases
    - Never share process
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Next Steps
