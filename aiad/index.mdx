AI-Assisted Development (AIAD) is a structured approach to integrating AI tools—particularly Claude Code—into your development workflow. This framework was developed at DormWay and adapted for Universal Audio's Zoo platform.

## What is AIAD?

AIAD is not just about using AI tools—it's a **complete development philosophy** designed to:

- **Preserve context** across development sessions
- **Automate repetitive tasks** with intelligent scripts
- **Maintain compliance** with security and privacy requirements
- **Enable parallel development** without context loss
- **Create institutional memory** through structured documentation

## Core Benefits

### 1. Context Preservation

The biggest challenge with AI-assisted development is context loss. When you switch tasks, Claude Code loses understanding of what you were working on. AIAD solves this through:

- **Git worktrees** with isolated Claude Code contexts
- **TASK.md templates** that prime Claude Code with rich context
- **Session commands** (`/session-start`, `/session-end`) that maintain state

### 2. Error Memory

When debugging fails, AIAD automatically searches documentation for past occurrences of similar errors. This prevents re-solving the same problem repeatedly.

### 3. Safety Interlocks

Development sessions can't end if tests or builds are failing. This ensures quality gates are enforced automatically.

### 4. Multi-Workspace Support

Maintain independent development environments (beta, dev, prod) with the same automation template.

## Key Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `.claude/commands/` | Custom slash commands for Claude Code |
| `scripts/` | 35+ automation scripts |
| `.workspace/` | Ephemeral working files (logs, features, exports) |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Primary AI guidance document |
| `Makefile` | Command interface for all operations |

## Philosophy

<Note>
AIAD treats the **development environment as a product**. Just as you invest in building great software, you should invest in building a great development experience.
</Note>

The framework is built on these principles:

1. **Separation of concerns** — Templates, repositories, and working files are kept distinct
2. **Automation over documentation** — Repetitive tasks become scripts, not wikis
3. **Context is king** — Every tool and process is designed to preserve and share context
4. **Safety by default** — Compliance checks and quality gates are built into the workflow
5. **Discoverability** — Commands are organized with `make help` and clear documentation
