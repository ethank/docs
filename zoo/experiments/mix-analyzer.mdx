## Overview

Analyzes mixes and provides specific, actionable feedback on improvements with UAD plugin recommendations.

**User Flow:**
- Producer uploads rough mix
- AI analyzes: frequency balance, dynamics, stereo field, loudness
- Returns specific feedback with plugin recommendations
- Suggests UAD plugins and settings to fix issues

## Technical Approach

### Architecture

```
Audio File
    ↓
FFT / Spectral Analysis
    ↓
Feature Vector (JSON)
    ↓
LLM (interprets features)
    ↓
Natural Language Response + Plugin Recommendations
```

### Key Components

**Audio Analysis (Server-Side):**
- FFT for frequency analysis
- Loudness measurement (LUFS)
- Stereo correlation
- Dynamic range analysis
- Peak detection

**Comparison Engine:**
- Compare against reference mixes in same genre
- Genre-specific targets (EDM vs jazz vs rock)
- Identify specific problem frequencies

**LLM Translation:**
- Convert technical metrics to musical language
- Explain WHY something is an issue
- Suggest specific UAD plugins and settings

## Example Output

**User uploads:** Rock mix with muddy low mids

**AI Analysis:**
```
Your mix has excessive 200-400Hz energy (muddiness).

Issues found:
- Bass and guitar competing in low-mid range
- Lack of clarity in vocal range
- Stereo field narrow below 500Hz

Recommended fixes:
1. Cut 3dB at 300Hz on bass using Neve 1073
2. High-pass filter guitar at 100Hz
3. Add stereo width to overhead drums using Ocean Way Studios
4. Boost 3kHz on vocals for presence using API 550A

Plugin recommendations:
- Neve 1073 (bass EQ)
- API 550A (vocal presence)
- Ocean Way Studios (drum width)
```

## Challenges

<Warning>
**Compute Cost:** Audio processing is expensive (around 0.10-0.50 per minute processed)

**Subjectivity:** "Good" mix depends on genre and artistic intent

**Reference Database:** Need library of professional mixes for comparison
</Warning>

## Cost Estimates

**Infrastructure:**
- Audio processing: 0.10-0.50 per minute
- LLM calls: 0.05-0.10 per analysis
- Storage: Minimal (delete audio after analysis)

**Expected Usage (Month 1):**
- 200 analyses at 3 min average
- Processing: 60-300
- LLM: 10-20
- **Total: 70-320 per month**

## When to Build This

<Info>
**Recommendation:** Build as **2nd or 3rd experiment** after validating Preset Detective

**Reasoning:**
- More complex audio processing
- Higher compute costs
- Requires reference database
- Start simpler, add complexity once platform is proven
