## When to Use This Roadmap

<Warning>
**Don't start here!** Only scale after:
- 2-3 experiments successfully validated (filled)
- 100+ daily active users across experiments
- Clear patterns emerging in infrastructure needs
- MVP platform becoming a bottleneck
</Warning>

**Use MVP stack (Week 1-8) first, scale only when necessary.**

---

## Overview

This roadmap takes the MVP Zoo Platform (built in Week 1) to production-grade infrastructure supporting multiple experiments at scale.

**Timeline:** 12 weeks
**Team:** 2-3 engineers
**Cost:** Around 200K over 12 weeks, 3-15K per month ongoing

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

### Goals
- Migrate from MVP to scalable architecture
- Add production-grade features
- Maintain 99.9% uptime SLA

### Infrastructure Upgrades

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Week 1-2: Backend">
**Migrate to Microservices:**
- API Gateway (Kong or AWS API Gateway)
- Experiment service (manages AI experiments)
- User service (auth, profiles, subscriptions)
- Analytics service (data pipeline)

**Add:**
- Redis for caching and rate limiting
- RabbitMQ or AWS SQS for message queue
- Background job processing (Bull or Temporal)

**Cost:** Around 500-1K per month
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Week 3-4: Database">
**Upgrade Neon:**
- Production tier with read replicas
- Automated backups (hourly)
- Point-in-time recovery

**Add Vector Database:**
- Migrate from pgvector to Pinecone or Qdrant
- Better performance for 100K+ presets
- Multi-index support for different experiments

**Cost:** Around 300-800 per month
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Deliverables

<Check>API Gateway routing to microservices</Check>
<Check>Redis caching (90% cache hit rate target)</Check>
<Check>Background job queue for long-running tasks</Check>
<Check>Database read replicas (reduce query latency 50%)</Check>
<Check>Automated backups and recovery tested</Check>

---

## Phase 2: Observability (Weeks 5-6)

### Goals
- Deep visibility into system performance
- Proactive alerting before users are affected
- Data-driven optimization

### Monitoring Stack

**Add:**
- **OpenTelemetry** - Distributed tracing
- **Grafana** - Dashboards and visualization
- **Prometheus** - Metrics collection

- Multi-region deployment
- Auto-scaling

### Kubernetes Migration

**Why Kubernetes:**
- Auto-scaling based on load
- Zero-downtime deployments
- Resource optimization
- Multi-cloud flexibility

**Deployment:**
- AWS EKS or Google GKE
- Separate clusters for prod/staging
- Horizontal pod autoscaling
- Load balancing

**Services to Containerize:**
- API gateway
- Experiment runner
- Background workers
- Analytics pipeline

### CDN and Edge

**Add:**
- **Cloudflare** or **AWS CloudFront**
- Edge caching for static assets
- DDoS protection
- Geographic load balancing

### Multi-Region

**Regions:**
- US East (primary)
- US West (failover)
- EU (GDPR compliance)

**Database:**
- Multi-region read replicas
- Cross-region backup
- Geo-routing

**Cost:** Around 2-5K per month

---

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Weeks 10-12)

### Real-Time Features

**Add:**
- WebSocket support for streaming responses
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for progress updates
- Real-time collaboration (multiple users, shared sessions)

### Audio Processing Pipeline

**For Mix Analyzer and future audio experiments:**
- Dedicated audio processing cluster
- GPU instances for ML models
- Audio format conversion pipeline
- Streaming audio analysis

**Infrastructure:**
- AWS Lambda for serverless processing
- S3 for temporary audio storage
- MediaConvert for transcoding

### ML Model Hosting

**Self-Hosted Models (optional):**
- Deploy smaller models on own infrastructure
- Reduce LLM costs for high-volume queries
- Custom fine-tuned models for music domain

**Options:**
- AWS SageMaker
- Google Vertex AI
- Self-managed GPU clusters

**When to consider:**
- LLM costs exceed 5K per month
- Need custom models not available via API
- Privacy requirements for audio processing
