## What is Zoo?

Zoo is Universal Audio's **AI prototyping platform** for shipping consumer-facing music applications in 1-2 weeks instead of months.

<Info>
Goal: 8-week "fill or kill" cycles - validate AI products fast, kill losers, scale winners.

## Recommended First Experiment: Preset Detective

### What It Is

AI assistant that helps musicians discover UAD presets:
- **User:** "I need a warm analog bass"
- **AI:** Recommends 3-5 specific presets with reasoning
- **Result:** Direct revenue through plugin sales

### Why Start Here

- **Clear ROI** - Plugin/preset sales (around $50K-200K/year potential)
- **Fast validation** - Text-only MVP in Week 1, add audio later
- **Uses UA moat** - UAD preset catalog + hardware ecosystem
- **Simple validation** - Recommendations helpful or not?
- **Expandable** - Start with text, add audio analysis in Week 4-6

### Week 1 Plan

<Steps>
  <Step title="Infrastructure Setup">
    Set up Neon, Clerk, Portkey, Sentry, PostHog (4-6 hours)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build Backend API">
    Express + tools + vector search (6-8 hours)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build Frontend">
    Next.js + Clerk + chat UI (6-8 hours)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy and Test">
    Railway + Vercel deployment (4-6 hours)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Launch Alpha">
    Seed presets, invite 10-15 testers (4 hours)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Total:** Approximately 30-40 hours engineering + $50-100/month infrastructure

**Deliverable:** Working app with 10-15 alpha users testing

## Technology Stack

### Infrastructure
- **Neon** - Postgres with pgvector (preset similarity search)
- **Railway** - Backend deployment (auto-scaling)
- **Vercel** - Frontend deployment
- **Clerk** - Authentication (social login, JWT)
- **Portkey** - LLM gateway (OpenAI + Anthropic fallbacks)

### Observability
- **Sentry** - Error tracking
- **PostHog** - Product analytics
- **Neon Analytics** - Database insights

### AI/ML
- **OpenAI** - GPT-4o-mini (primary), text-embedding-ada-002 (vectors)

- **pgvector** - Semantic preset search

### Frontend
- **Next.js 14** - App router, React Server Components
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Clerk Components** - Auth UI

### Backend
- **Express** - REST API
- **TypeScript** - Type safety
- **Zod** - Runtime validation

**Cost:** Approximately $90-140/month + LLM usage (around $20/500 sessions)

## 8-Week Timeline

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Week 1: MVP Build" icon="rocket">
    Day 1-5: Build platform + Preset Detective

    **Output:** Working app deployed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Week 2-3: Internal Alpha" icon="users">
    10-15 UA producers test

    **Goal:** 60%+ use it 3+ times, 70%+ find helpful
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Week 4-5: External Beta" icon="user-group">
    50-100 musicians invited. Add audio upload and preset comparison.

    **Goal:** 40%+ activation, 25%+ Day 7 retention
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Week 6-7: Measure and Iterate" icon="chart-line">
    Track metrics, fix issues, expand preset catalog to 100+

    **Goal:** Understand usage patterns, optimize
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Week 8: Fill or Kill Decision" icon="check-double">
    **Fill if:** More than 25% retention, NPS more than 30, team excited, cost less than $0.50/session

    **Kill if:** Below thresholds, users don't return, "cool but wouldn't pay"

    **If FILL:** Move to production, allocate 0.25 FTE, build 90-day roadmap

    **If KILL:** Document learnings, archive, move to next experiment

## Success Metrics

### Week 1 (MVP)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Time to deploy | Less than 5 days |
| Infrastructure cost | Less than $100/month |
| Engineering time | Less than 40 hours |
| Alpha testers invited | 10-15 |

### Week 8 (Fill or Kill)

| Metric | Fill Threshold | Kill Below |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Day 7 Retention | More than 25% | Less than 15% |
| NPS | More than 30 | Less than 0 |
| Activation | More than 40% | Less than 20% |
| Helpfulness | More than 65% | Less than 40% |
| Cost per Session | Less than $0.50 | More than $2.00 |

<Warning>
**Decision:** Must hit ALL fill thresholds to continue. Even one miss equals kill.
</Warning>

## Cost Comparison

| Approach | Time | Cost | Risk | Output |
|----------|------|------|------|--------|
| **Traditional Build** | 6-12 months | $500K-1M | High | 1 product (might fail) |
| **Zoo: 3 Experiments** | 24 weeks | $75K | Low | 3 validated ideas, keep winners |
| **Difference** | 6 months faster | $425K-925K saved | Fail fast | 3x learning |

<Note>
**Portfolio approach:** Run 10 experiments per year, expect 3-4 to fill, archive 6-7. Ship winners to production.
</Note>

## When to Scale

**Only after:**
- 2-3 experiments validated (filled)
- 100+ daily active users across experiments
- Clear patterns emerging (shared infrastructure needs)
- Team can't iterate fast enough with current setup

**Then add:**
- Temporal (complex workflow orchestration)
- Better observability (OpenTelemetry, Grafana)
- Auto-scaling infrastructure
- Advanced features (streaming, webhooks)

See [Deployment Roadmap](/zoo/deployment/roadmap) for 12-week production build plan.

**Cost:** $200K over 12 weeks, $3-15K/month ongoing

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do we need the full platform before first experiment?">
    No! Week 1 MVP is enough. Add production features (Temporal, etc.) only when needed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if our first experiment fails?">
    Perfect! You learned in 8 weeks for $25K instead of 6 months for $500K. Pick next experiment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How many experiments can we run simultaneously?">
    Start with 1. Max 3 with a dedicated team. More equals context switching equals slower progress.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can we extend past 8 weeks if we're close?">
    No. 8 weeks is plenty. If you can't prove value in 8 weeks, you won't in 12. Kill and move on.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What about audio processing and ML models?">
    Start with text and features only (Week 1). Add audio processing Week 4-6 if validated. No premature optimization.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Which experiment should we start with?">
    Preset Detective. Clear ROI, fastest validation, uses UA moat, text-only MVP.
  </Accordion>
