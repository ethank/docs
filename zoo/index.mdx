## Recommended First Experiment: Preset Detective

### What It Is

AI assistant that helps musicians discover UAD presets:
- **User:** "I need a warm analog bass"
- **AI:** Recommends 3-5 specific presets with reasoning
- **Result:** Direct revenue through plugin sales

### Why Start Here

<Check>**Clear ROI** - Plugin/preset sales (~$50K-200K/year potential)</Check>
<Check>**Fast validation** - Text-only MVP in Week 1, add audio later</Check>
<Check>**Uses UA moat** - UAD preset catalog + hardware ecosystem</Check>
<Check>**Simple validation** - Recommendations helpful or not?</Check>
<Check>**Expandable** - Start with text, add audio analysis in Week 4-6</Check>

### Week 1 Plan

<Steps>
  <Step title="Infrastructure Setup">
    Set up Neon, Clerk, Portkey, Sentry, PostHog (4-6 hours)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build Backend API">
    Express + tools + vector search (6-8 hours)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build Frontend">
    Next.js + Clerk + chat UI (6-8 hours)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Deploy & Test">
    Railway + Vercel deployment (4-6 hours)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Launch Alpha">
    Seed presets, invite 10-15 testers (4 hours)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Total:** ~30-40 hours engineering + $50-100/month infrastructure

**Deliverable:** Working app at https://zoo.uaudio.com with 10-15 alpha users

## 8-Week Timeline

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Week 1: MVP Build" icon="rocket">
    - Day 1-5: Build platform + Preset Detective
    - **Output:** Working app deployed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Week 2-3: Internal Alpha" icon="users">
    - 10-15 UA producers test
    - **Goal:** 60%+ use it 3+ times, 70%+ find helpful
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Week 4-5: External Beta" icon="user-group">
    - 50-100 musicians invited
    - Add: Audio upload, preset comparison
    - **Goal:** 40%+ activation, 25%+ Day 7 retention
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Week 6-7: Measure & Iterate" icon="chart-line">
    - Track metrics, fix issues
    - Expand preset catalog to 100+
    - **Goal:** Understand usage patterns, optimize
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Week 8: Fill or Kill Decision" icon="check-double">
    - **Fill if:** >25% retention, NPS >30, team excited, cost <$0.50/session
    - **Kill if:** Below thresholds, users don't return, "cool but wouldn't pay"

    **If FILL:** Move to production, allocate 0.25 FTE, build 90-day roadmap

    **If KILL:** Document learnings, archive, move to next experiment
  </Accordion>

## Success Metrics

### Week 1 (MVP)

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Time to deploy | < 5 days |
| Infrastructure cost | < $100/month |
| Engineering time | < 40 hours |
| Alpha testers invited | 10-15 |

### Week 8 (Fill or Kill)

| Metric | Fill Threshold | Kill Below |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Day 7 Retention | > 25% | < 15% |
| NPS | > 30 | < 0 |
| Activation | > 40% | < 20% |
| Helpfulness | > 65% | < 40% |
| Cost/Session | < $0.50 | > $2.00 |

<Warning>
**Decision:** Must hit ALL fill thresholds to continue. Even one miss = kill.
</Warning>

## Cost Comparison

| Approach | Time | Cost | Risk | Output |
|----------|------|------|------|--------|
| **Traditional Build** | 6-12 months | $500K-1M | High | 1 product (might fail) |
| **Zoo: 3 Experiments** | 24 weeks | $75K | Low | 3 validated ideas, keep winners |
| **Difference** | 6 months faster | $425K-925K saved | Fail fast | 3x learning |

<Note>
**Portfolio approach:** Run 10 experiments/year, expect 3-4 to fill, archive 6-7. Ship winners to production.
</Note>

## When to Scale (Move to Full Platform)

**Only after:**
- ✅ 2-3 experiments validated (filled)
- ✅ 100+ daily active users across experiments
- ✅ Clear patterns emerging (shared infrastructure needs)
- ✅ Team can't iterate fast enough with current setup

**Then add:**
- Temporal (complex workflow orchestration)
- Better observability (OpenTelemetry, Grafana)
- Auto-scaling infrastructure
- Advanced features (streaming, webhooks)

See [Deployment Roadmap](/zoo/deployment/roadmap) for 12-week production build plan.

**Cost:** $200K over 12 weeks, $3-15K/month ongoing

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do we need the full platform before first experiment?">
    **No!** Week 1 MVP is enough. Add production features (Temporal, etc.) only when needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if our first experiment fails?">
    **Perfect!** You learned in 8 weeks for $25K instead of 6 months for $500K. Pick next experiment.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How many experiments can we run simultaneously?">
    Start with **1**. Max **3** with a dedicated team. More = context switching = slower.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can we extend past 8 weeks if we're close?">
    **No.** 8 weeks is plenty. If you can't prove value in 8 weeks, you won't in 12. Kill and move on.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What about audio processing / ML models?">
    Start with text/features only (Week 1). Add audio processing Week 4-6 if validated. **No premature optimization.**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which experiment should we start with?">
    **Preset Detective.** Clear ROI, fastest validation, uses UA moat, text-only MVP.
  </Accordion>
